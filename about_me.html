          My name is RATONGAMANAHAJA Francois Valentino Jacquit. I am still a beginner of a web developer. I am still studying at ONJA to be a web developer. After one and a half month of starting learning CODING, I tried to apply what I have learnt about HTML to build this website. I created this website to give an access to those who want to learn about HTML. I am trying to improve my experience of writing code now by starting to learn about <q>CSS</q> and <q>javascript</q>
