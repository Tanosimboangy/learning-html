          A brief description of HTML
        </h2>
        <h3>
          According to the definition
        </h3>
        <p>
          HTML stands for <q>Hypertext Markup Language</q>. HTML is the language used to create webpages. <q>Hypertext</q> refers to the hyperlinks that an HTML page may contain. "Markup language" is the way tags are used to define the page layout and elements within the page.
        </p>
        <h3>
          As for other meaning
        </h3>
        <p>
          HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other things into visual or audible web pages.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Structure of HTML5
        </h3>
        <p>
          When working with HTML, we use simple code structures <q>tag</q> and <q>attributes</q> to mark up a website page. For example, we can create a paragraph by placing the enclosed text within a starting <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
          The three block level tags every HTML document needs to contain are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <a href="html.html">Html</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="head.html">Head</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="body.html">Body</a>
          </li>
        </ol>

          My name is RATONGAMANAHAJA Francois Valentino Jacquit. I am still a beginner of a web developer. I am still studying at ONJA to be a web developer. After one and a half month of starting learning CODING, I tried to apply what I have learnt about HTML to build this website. I created this website to give an access to those who want to learn about HTML. I am trying to improve my experience of writing code now by starting to learn about <q>CSS</q> and <q>javascript</q>
